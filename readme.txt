PA1 - RPC

The following code implements a basic RPC system for rotating a string. It
consists of two main executables: a client and a server. The server must be ran
before the client. The client, when ran, will attempt to connect to the server,
and on a successful connection, send the direction it wants its string rotated,
and then the string it wants rotated. It will then print the rotated string out
after being recieved from the server.
